In order to better understand what is webdriver, we recommend reading [this document](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/). 

## Sessions
> A session is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular user agent, including all its child browsers. WebDriver gives each session a unique session ID that can be used to differentiate one session from another, allowing multiple user agents to be controlled from a single HTTP server, and allowing sessions to be routed via a multiplexer (known as an intermediary node).

## Is Ready
## New Session
## Delete Session

## Timeouts
>A timeouts configuration is a record of the different timeouts that control the behavior of script evaluation, navigation, and element retrieval:

## Get Timeouts
## Set Timeouts
## Set Timeout Script
## Set Timeout PageLoad
## Set Timeout Implicit
---

## Navigation
>The commands in this section allow navigation of the current top-level browsing context to new URLs and introspection of the document currently loaded in this browsing context.

## Navigate To
## Get Current Url
## Get Title
## Back
## Forward
## Refresh
---

## Element Retrieval
>The Find Element, Find Elements, Find Element From Element, and Find Elements From Element commands allow lookup of individual elements and collections of elements. Element retrieval searches are performed using pre-order traversal of the document’s nodes that match the provided selector’s expression. Elements are serialized and returned as web elements.

## Find Element
You can use `find_element` method to find a element.
```sh
find_element ${property} ${value}
```

The `${property}` is following:
- 'id'
- 'name'
- 'css selector'
- 'link text'
- 'partial link text'
- 'tag name'
- 'class name'
- 'xpath'

To find multiple elements, you can use `find_elements` method.
```sh
find_elements ${property} ${value}
```

### Find Element By Id

Example usage:
```html
<html>
<body>
  <p id="welcome">Hi, there!</p>
</body>
<html>
```

Command usage:
```sh
element=$(find_element 'id' 'welcome')
```

### Find Element By Name

Example usage:
```html
<html>
<body>
  <input name="username" type="text" />
</body>
<html>
```

Command usage:
```sh
element=$(find_element 'name' 'username')
```

### Find Element By Css Selector

Example usage:
```html
<html>
<body>
  <p class="content">Site content goes here.</p>
</body>
<html>
```

Command usage:
```sh
element=$(find_element 'css selector' 'p.content')
```

### Find Element By Link Text

Example usage:
```html
<html>
<body>
  <a href="login.html">Login</a>
</body>
<html>
```

Command usage:
```sh
element=$(find_element 'link text' 'Login')
```

### Find Element By Partial Link Text

Example usage:
```html
<html>
<body>
  <a href="login.html">Login</a>
</body>
<html>
```

Command usage:
```sh
element=$(find_element 'partial link text' 'Log')
```

### Find Element By Tag Name

Example usage:
```html
<html>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
</body>
<html>
```

Command usage:
```sh
element=$(find_element 'tag name' 'h1')
```

### Find Element By Class Name

Example usage:
```html
<html>
<body>
  <h1 class="title">Welcome</h1>
</body>
<html>
```

Command usage:
```sh
element=$(find_element 'class name' 'title')
```

### Find Element By Xpath

Example usage:
```html
<html>
<body>
  <div id="contents">
    <p>welcome</p>
    <p>here</p>
  </div>
</body>
<html>
```

Command usage:
```sh
element=$(find_element 'xpath' '//*[@id="contents"]/p[1]')
```

## Find Elements
## Find Element From Element
## Find Elements From Element
## Get Active Element
---

## Element State
>To calculate the absolute position of element:

## Get Attribute
## Get Property
## Get Css Value
## Get Text
## Get Tag Name
## Get Rect
## Is Element Enabled
---

## Element Interaction
>The element interaction commands provide a high-level instruction set for manipulating form controls. Unlike Actions, they will implicitly scroll elements into view and check that it is an interactable element.

## Send Keys
## Click
## Element Clear

## Context
>Many WebDriver commands happen in the context of either the current browsing context or current top-level browsing context. The current top-level browsing context is represented in the protocol by its associated window handle. When a top-level browsing context is selected using the Switch To Window command, a specific browsing context can be selected using the Switch to Frame command.

## Get Window Handle
## Get Window Handles
## Delete Window
## New Window
## Switch To Window
## Get Window Rect
## Set Window Rect
## Maximize Window
## Minimize Window
## Fullscreen Window
